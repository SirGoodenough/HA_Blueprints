  name: Aqara Magic Cube ZHA - 2024-06-04
  author: SirGoodenough
  description: >
    This Blueprint uses a Z2M Event Sensor to sort out the 38(+54)
    unique actions available from the Xiaomi Magic Cube Remote. (Some unique actions
    are available thru templating only. See the related document.)

    The split out of functions gives you the ability to assign local scripts or functions
    to do the things you want the remote to do.

    Functions that are left empty will simply do nothing.


    ### 🍎 There is a set of 36 event functions that will trigger on specific actions
    on specific sides that are listed as **Group 1 actions 🍎**.


    ### 🍒 There is a set of 6 event functions that will trigger on specific actions
    on *ANY* side that are listed as **Group 2 sctions 🍒**.


    ### 🍐 There is a set of 30 event functions that will trigger on cube flips to
    & froma specific sides that are listed as **Group 3 sctions 🍐**.


    ### 🍕 There are 2 actions (shake and drop) that only occur once and are OK to
    be combined with any other group. Listed as **Group 4 sections 🍕**.


    Please be aware that ALL actions except the 2 listed above,

    🍕 will trigger an action in **ALL 3 groups at the same time** every time. Therefore
    I suggest if you just have a couple of things you want this remote to do that
    you choose the *ANY / Group 2 / 🍒* events.

    If you want more than a few events, you should select actions in **Group 1 / 🍎
    OR Group 3 / 🍐**.

    With careful selection you can use mixed groups, but you run the risk of a single
    cube action triggering more than 1 Home Assistant action and making a mess of
    things 🍱.


    #### NOTICE: This cube *can* be triggered 124 ways, but only 38(+54) of them are
    unique (with templating).


    There is sample code to make the template sensor in the help file on GitHib named
    [Zigbee2MQTT - Xiaomi Cube Controller.md](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Automations/Zigbee2MQTT%20-%20Xiaomi%20Cube%20Controller.md)
    & in the [community page related to this](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zigbee2mqtt-xiaomi-cube-controller/393203).


    Within this blueprint there is an event handler that will latch the last action
    that the blueprint finds and sends that to the event buss. From there a simple
    Template sensor can grab it and show you the last action sent. Thie will help
    when setting up new functions and to troubleshoot strange behaviours.

    >I sincerely thank Them for their work. 
    I wanted to support a version that was virtually the same as my Z2M version, 
    and leverage all the documentation and code samples there but still port it 
    to ZHA. I also had a better idea for troubleshooting info.

    📩 There is not an official version control system for Blueprints. However I have
    found something that comes pretty close. It is not perfect, but for **MOST**
    Blueprints, it does just fine. I encourage you to check this script out and use
    it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint. 🔗 [koter84 Blueprint Update Script](https://github.com/koter84/HomeAssistant_Blueprints_Update/)

        This blueprint has 2 required inputs.
        
        The Last side up is a helper you need to set-up and it is used to track the
          last side up from the last action. The cube also has a variable for this,
          but it is for whatever readon not populated in all actions, and in order 
          for this blueprint to have some of the actions, this vale is always needed.

        Also required is of course the cube identifier.

          If you only want the cube to work like this in the morning,
          then after 6pm you want it to do different actions, add a condition that
          will only let this run from 6am until 6pm. Then have another copy of
          the blueprint that will only run from 6pm until 6am. (for example)

          Any valid conditions you can dream up, you should be able to add here.

          Leave it as the default of you don't want to add a condition of your own.
