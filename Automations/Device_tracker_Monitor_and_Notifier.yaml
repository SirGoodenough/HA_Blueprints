  name: Notify if selected Device_Tracker goes down and do something about it - 2023-03-01

  description: 'This is intended to be used with pfSense HACS Integration: 
    [GitHub - travisghansen/hass-pfsense: pfSense integration with Home Assistant ](https://github.com/travisghansen/hass-pfsense)
    . However it could be used with any device tracker that reports ```home``` when the 
    device is up and something else when it isn''t.

    It will create a persistent notification when triggered.

    Triggers / notifications can be enabled for a time period each day and/or for 
    specific days of the week. There is also the ability to roll your own specific 
    notification or other action as an action statement.

    I also found that Awesome Blueprints Matt has a blueprint to send this stuff 
    to your phone, so I referenced that here to be helpful if you are looking for that.
    If you want to send these notifications to a mobile device, i suggest you look at
    the following blueprint to use in conjunction with this blueprint. I am not 
    affiliated with that, but decided I didn''t want to re-invent the wheel as 
    mobile HA is not something I do every day.

    ## 🐘 Requirements
    
    ### Persistent Notification Integration Required

    You must have this integration enabled on your system to run the automation, since 
    the these notifications are generated by this integration. This should be 
    activated in your HA Instance by default, so unless you tweaked the default 
    configuration, you''re good to go.

    ### [Persistent Notification Integration Docs ](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/persistent_notification/)

    📩 There is not an official version control system for Blueprints. However I have 
    found something that comes pretty close. It is not perfect, but for **MOST** 
    Blueprints, it does just fine. I encourage you to check this script out and use 
    it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint. [🔗koter84 Blueprint Update Script ](https://github.com/koter84/HomeAssistant_Blueprints_Update/)
