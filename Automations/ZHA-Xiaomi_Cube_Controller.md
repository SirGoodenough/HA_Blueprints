(128 possible actions!!) Aqara works with T1 Pro and older cubes. This Blueprint uses a ZHA built sensor to sort out the 38(+54) commands available from the Xiaomi Magic Cube. This gives you the ability to trigger actions using the remote. NOTICE: Using this Blueprint and example scripts, this cube *can* be triggered over a hundred ways, but only 38(+54) of them are unique...

## 🔧 * Hardware Versions

Aqara / Lumi has released a new version of the cube. Box name listed as Cube T1 Pro. It is listed in your ZHA Device panel as ```lumi.remote.cagl02 by LUMI```.

This device will work similar to the older versions if configured in the ```ACTION``` mode and NOT the ```SCENE``` mode. The exception being that the ```Drop``` function is no longer available.

If the only functions that you have available is rotate left/right and shake, your cube is in the wrong mode. To change modes, push the ```LINK``` button 5x swiftly and the mode should flip to the ```ACTION``` mode where the functions should work normally. You can test this by setting up the event sensor listed below and listening for 'zha_cube_last_action' events or by listening for 'zha_events' in the Developer event panel.

## 🔮 About this blueprint

Type of blueprint: AUTOMATION

What if I am having problems getting it going?

> You can contact me for help, [see the links below](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Automations/ZHA-Xiaomi_Cube_Controller.md#contacts).

Why do I need this?

> The Cube remote/switch device has a lot of ways to trigger it. This Blueprint makes it a bit easier to figure out what you are doing and remembering that in the future. It also makes sure the trigger is as clean and repeatable as possible, screening out false triggers and making the log clean and the experience good overall.

#### 🗿License Notice:

* Copies of the original Blueprint that were converted via the 'Take Control' feature or other means are officially not supported by me.

* I may or may not be able to support you when you have a problem after you make changes to my code, as some of the code is no longer mine.

* I & my license also require attribution as a link back to the original should you use this code in your own creation.

* [Here is a link to my license & the original github post](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints?tab=License-1-ov-file) expected to be followed & referenced as attribution should you use this code elsewhere.

## 🔧 Configuration

Requirements

* To make the Blueprint work you will need a functional Magic Cube integrated to Home Assistant thru ZHA and find the sensor Device in the Home Assistant Device tab.
* My 'suggestion' is that you do separate scripts for most, if not all of the actions you generate here. If you are using the UI editor for the simple things you are fine, but for more complicated things scripts may work better for you. This is my opinion and how I am using it, to each their own. See my example dimmer script below...
* For this Blueprint to function properly, it must keep track of the last cube face that was triggered. This is done with an input_number helper. [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your helper entities.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/helpers.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/helpers/)

## 👀 ✈️ Extended Information

This Blueprint uses a ZHA Event Sensor to sort out the 38(+54) unique actions available from the Xiaomi Magic Cube Remote. (Some unique actions are available thru templating only. See the related document.)

The split out of functions gives you the ability to assign local scripts or functions
to do the things you want the remote to do.

Functions that are left empty will simply do nothing.

### 🍎 There is a set of 36 event functions that will trigger on specific actions
on specific sides that are listed as **Group 1 actions 🍎**.

### 🍒 There is a set of 6 event functions that will trigger on specific actions
on *ANY* side that are listed as **Group 2 sctions 🍒**.

### 🍐 There is a set of 30 event functions that will trigger on cube flips to
& from a specific sides that are listed as **Group 3 sctions 🍐**.

### 🍕 There are 2 actions (shake and drop) that only occur once and are OK to
be combined with any other group. Listed as **Group 4 sections 🍕**.

Please be aware that ALL actions except the 2 listed above,

🍕 will trigger an action in **ALL 3 groups at the same time** every time. Therefore
I suggest if you just have a couple of things you want this remote to do that
you choose the *ANY / Group 2 / 🍒* events.

If you want more than a few events, you should select actions in **Group 1 / 🍎
OR Group 3 / 🍐**.

With careful selection you can use mixed groups, but you run the risk of a single
cube action triggering more than 1 Home Assistant action and making a mess of
things 🍱.

**NOTE:** This blueprint references the sides from 0 to 5 like the 
ZHA integration does. *Most* ZHA blueprints reference the sides in the same
order but use 1 thru 6. This was so I could re-use my Z2M code as-is.
This does not affect the operation of the device.

## 🪄 My Cube triggers on the Desk with a slight Bump. How do I fix that?

I have 3 of these cubes. If you aren't careful they trigger and do all kinds of things just sitting on the desk. Awesome when you want it to do this, but a HUGE PITA if you don't.

A friend of mine came up with this and it works awesome. He didn't want people hassling him about remixes and such, so he let me put it on the Thingiverse. I printed one for each of my cubes and because it's now parked at a diagonal it will not trigger, unless you knock it on the floor or something. I highly suggest you print yourself one of these or find someone to print one for you.... It will make cube life much simpler...
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4536778

#### NOTICE: This cube *can* be triggered over a hundred ways, but only 38 of them are unique

## 🔧 How does this darn cube work?

There is sample code to make the template sensor in the help file on GitHib named the same as this one and in the community page related to this.

#### Seeing the cube commands for training the operator

Within this blueprint there is an event handler that will latch the last command that the blueprint finds and sends that to the event buss. From there a simple Template sensor can grab it and show you the last action sent.This will help when setting up new functions and to troubleshoot strange behaviors. Add an entity card in your dashboard for sensor.cube_last_action to see what actions occur as you move the cube.

[Yaml file that contains the sample code here](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Samples/Cube_Last_Action_Template_Trigger_SAMPLE.yaml)

#### Event Sensor in Action

![Sample Script Generation Dashboard Entry](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/images/cubesensor.gif?raw=true "Sensor in action")

If you wish to 'store' these events you can add this sensor to recorder and it will save them for you.

## 🫳 Getting Tap and Flip actions to work

I have had reports of the 'tap' action working. It was due to the lack of instructions provided by the manufacturer of the cube. Tap actions on the cube are initiated by sharply tapping the cube 2x on a hard surface like this:

![Demo of Tap Action](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/images/Tap_Action.gif?raw=true "Demo of Tap Action")

In a similar manner, flips need to tap the surface at the end of the 90 or 180 flip. Setting up the template sensor above will help train you in the force needed for all the actions.

## 🤹‍♀️ Getting The Cube Interviewed and Into Action Mode

This cube has a Scene Mode and an Action Mode. Most people will want to choose Action Mode for ZHA because it has more functions available. The ZHA Quirk for this Does not have Scene Mode functions available, so most of the features will not be available to you if you choose that one.

You can tell what mode it's in by what functions show up in the log visible in the device screen.

If the thing doesn't respond at all, it didn't complete the interview correctly. This happened to me many many times... I eventually found if I start 'add device' in ZHA, then hold down the button until it flashes AND keep holding it down until it flashes again, it **usually** completes the interview. I also found that a couple of times I had to disable the device and remove it from ZHA Completely before it would re-interview and be functional again. I'm testing this thru a mesh device as I am not close to my ZHA coordinator where I am sitting, but that is my experience with it today.

If it will rotate left, rotate right, shake and slide only then it's in Scene Mode. You are missing a bunch of functions. Funny enough it also does the throw and hold function but ZHA has no idea what they are and just report in the log something happened that it doesn't have a name for.
![Some of the functions available in Scene Mode](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/images/ZHASceneMode.png?raw=true "Log showing Scene Mode Actions")

However if it will do all those things plus do a flip, slide, and knock function, it is in action mode. Action mode doesn't do Hold function, but that is cube design.
![Some of the functions available in Action Mode](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/images/ZHASceneMode.png?raw=true "Log showing Action Mode Actions")

Now, how do you change it...
* I found if you click it 6 rimes slowly so it blinks between, it just registers a button push in the log and nothing happens.
* If you hold the button too long, it tries to re-interview.
* If you click the button 6 times quick (no flashing between), the log doesn't show anything, but the mode changes. You should see a switch to the other function list above and it has switched modes without telling you bupkis. Also, that sucks.

I completely understand why people are having problems...

## 🌞 Dimmer Control

If you are looking for a dimmer control to change brightness based on rotation, here's something I cobbled together from other community posts here and there. ( Credit https://community.home-assistant.io/u/yourigh/summary and others )

I did this with all the complicated stuff in a script that is called with data from the blueprint automation. Then the complicated part is all in 1 place and there is only 1 copy of it. The same script works for both increase and decrease of brightness because the angle in the cube goes positive when turning clockwise and negative when going counter clockwise.

[Code Examples are found in the Yaml file here](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Samples/ZHA_Cube_Dimmer_Control_Stub_Actions_and_Script_SAMPLE.yaml)
If you want to create the script file using a script BluePrint, I have that for you right here: [Dimmer Control BluePrint](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Scripts/dimmer_control_4_magic_cube.yaml)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSirGoodenough%2FHA_Blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FScripts%2Fdimmer_control_4_magic_cube.yaml)


* The script reduces the angle number to 40% of the rotation angle (you can change this, but 40% works well for my needs).
* It then grabs the current brightness from the light entity (as a % of the full scale 255 number).
* The new_brightness target is then calculated.
* It then checks if the light is already off, and if so, leaves it off.
* It makes sure the new_brightness is above, in my case, 10% so all the lights come on.
* It then makes sure that if new_brightness >90%, it is set to 100% and not over that.
* Finally it provides the calculated brightness %.

## 🚦 Color Control

I also extended this to controlling the color one octet (color) at a time. Each color will use both rotations on one side of the cube. Colors are changed one at a time (Red or Green or Blue) and change the amount (positive or negative) based on how far you rotate the cube.

[Code Examples are found in the Yaml file here](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Samples/ZHA_Cube_Color_Control_Stub_Actions_and_Script_SAMPLE.yaml)
If you want to create the color change script file using a script BluePrint, I have that for you right here: [Color Change BluePrint](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Scripts/color_control_4_magic_cube.yaml)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSirGoodenough%2FHA_Blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FScripts%2Fcolor_control_4_magic_cube.yaml)

* The script reduces the angle number to 60% of the rotation angle (you can change this, but 60% works well for my needs).
* It then grabs the current colors from the light entity and puts them into a list.
* The new color target is then calculated.
* It makes sure the new color is not negative.
* It then makes sure that the new color is not over 255.
* Finally it provides the calculated color if not in the limits.

This can be used over and over for as many lights as you want to control. But you **will** need to repeat this and modify it for red and blue color octets.

## 🔁 🔴 Using Rotate CW and CCW as a Short-Press / Long-Press Toggle

Not enough switch positions for you?  **How about a possible 24 more?**  I came up with some scripts you can add to Home Assistant and call for more actions. One is for CW rotation < 100 degrees, another for > 100 degrees. Also the same for CCW. These are can be called from the Group 1 🍎 rotate actions and the Group 2 🍒 rotate actions. Match the CW call/recieve or the CCW call/receive pairs together or you are going to be sad. 😩

Here is a sample of what you put into the script Blueprint UI. It will need to be a manual YAML edit and contain your specific variables. What you see here is one from my config.

[Code Examples are found in the Yaml file here](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Samples/ZHA_Cube_Rotate_Long_and_Short_press_SAMPLE.yaml)
If you want to create the long / short rotation switch script file using a script BluePrint, I have that for you right here: [Long Short Rotation Switch BluePrint](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Scripts/long_short_toggle_4_magic_cube.yaml)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSirGoodenough%2FHA_Blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FScripts%2Flong_short_toggle_4_magic_cube.yaml)

You can also do this buy going full gui and picking the matching template out of the below section and filling it in similar to this:

![Full GUI Example](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/images/full_GUI_Example.png?raw=true "Full GUI Example")

These are the standalone scripts that are 'called' from the Script calling yaml shown above. If you don't need all of these only install the ones you will use.

This is a [homeassistant.toggle action](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homeassistant#service-homeassistanttoggle), so it can toggle anything that that service can handle. Changing it to homeassistant.turn_on or homeassistant.turn_off would change the behavior slightly if this fits your needs better. Using this integration, you can control lights, switches, locks, and lots of different things.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSirGoodenough%2FHA_Blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FScripts%2Flong_short_toggle_4_magic_cube.yaml)

## 🎧 Volume Control

This script was invented to be used with my Magic Cube Blueprints. I released it as a standalone Script Blueprint because because of requests to extend the function of my BP's with how to convert cube rotation to volume in other places. Research found me this [Post from Petro](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/cant-seem-to-set-volume-level-based-on-itself-from-data-template/237089/11?u=sir_goodenough) which had a very elegant solution to the problem, It was very easy decision to adopt it here.

[Code Examples are found in the Yaml file here](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Samples/ZHA_Cube_Volume_Control_Stub_Actions_and_Script_SAMPLE.yaml)
If you want to create the script file using a script BluePrint, I have that for you right here: [Volume Control BluePrint](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Scripts/volume_control_4_magic_cube.yaml)
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSirGoodenough%2FHA_Blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FScripts%2Fvolume_control_4_magic_cube.yaml)

* The script scales the angle number of the rotation angle (you can change this, but 30 works well for my needs).
* You send the script the media_player that you want to adjust.
* You use a template (examples in the script BP description) to send the angle to the script.
* Some math happens and it uses the amount you turn the cube to adjust the volume.

#### NOTICE when building action scripts...

It has been found that some set-ups use ```trigger.payload_json.action_angle``` here and others only accept ```trigger.payload_json.angle``` here. I have not been able to determine which attributes are available in which version of firmware and/or configurations, so it is up to you to determine the one you need here. Look in the Device listing for this cube and determine which version of angle is one of the listed sensors. That would be the one to use here.

## Method to use Group 3 🍐 actions and not interfere with Group 1 🍎

Not enough switch positions for you still?  **How about another posible 30 more?** 

This is another 'action' that I stumbled upon. I noticed if you turn the cube from side to side very gently, it will internally register as being on a new side, but the flip action doesn't register. Then if you slide the cube, it will send out an action of slide on side 5 from side 2, or whatever side combo's you choose. I used 5 from 2 in the example, but you can use any of them.

![Showing slide 5 from 2 on the Cube Action Sensor](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/images/Slide5From2.png?raw=true "Showing slide 5 from 2 on the Cube Action Sensor")

I'll be honest, this is the trickiest thing to do yet and I'm not sure it is worth the trouble, but if you want an action in your pocket as a secret action that only you know, this is the trick. Using a soft surface like a towel helps to keep the flip from registering when you set it down.

> NOTE: In this example the slide side 5 will also trigger. You may need to add a condition to prevent that from triggering. An example for this 5 from 2 example is to put this condition on the slide side 5 action ```{{ not last_side == 2 }}``` before the thing you want to do. Or you can just not have a slide 5 action.

It is as simple as adding a condition of let's say 'slide' in one of the Group 3 🍐 slots.

Here is the GUI editor showing this.

## 🌞 ❄️ Troubleshooting tip

If you are troubleshooting and you want to see more traces back when doing so, here is a TIP I've found.
Manually edit the automation created with the ui editor (or manually with a text editor) and add the following to have this automation contain 10 traces instead of the normal 5. Then if the automation is triggering often, you can see the last 10 traces to help you decide what the issue is.
[HA Docs on this here.](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/troubleshooting/#traces)

```yaml
trace:
  stored_traces: 10
```

## 📩 **Version Updates**

Updates will be published on my [GIT repository](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints) with the rest of my Home Assistant Blueprint collection.

📩 There is not an official version control system for Blueprints. However I have found something that comes pretty close. It is not perfect, but for **MOST** Blueprints, it does just fine. I encourage you to check this script out and use it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint. [🔗koter84 Blueprint Update Script ](https://github.com/koter84/HomeAssistant_Blueprints_Update/)
