  name: Aqara Magic Cube Zigbee2MQTT - 2022-03-17
  description: "This Blueprint uses a Zigbee2MQTT built sensor to sort out the multitude 
  of commands from the Xiaomi Magic Cube Remote. The split out of functions gives you 
  the ability to assign local scripts or functions to do the things you want the remote to do.  
  Functions that are left empty will simply do nothing.  

  There is sample code to make the template sensor in the help file on GitHib named the same 
  as this one and in the community page related to this.

  Within this blueprint there is an event handler that will latch the last command that the
  blueprint finds and sends that to the event buss. From there a simple Template sensor 
  can grab it and show you the last action sent. Thie will help  when setting up new
  functions and to troubleshoot strange behaviours.

  This was forked from https://community.home-assistant.io/t/z2m-xiaomi-cube-controller/263006 
  V1.2 project authored by luckypoppy and the friends he pulled together to create the base.  
  I sincerely thank Him (Them) for their work. I felt there needed to be more documentation 
  for rookie users to properly set this up. I had quite a few questions and when I saw a few questions 
  in that chat from people struggling, I wanted to help. 
  I also had a better idea for troubleshooting info that didn't involve the log writes."
