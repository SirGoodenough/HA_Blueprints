  name: State 1 temperature ramp control-2024-06-08
  author: SirGoodenough
  description: >
    This ramps up the thermostat just enough at a time to keep your stage 2 
    (or emergency) heat from activating. This is meant to be run for instance in 
    the morning when the system is recovering from overnight thermostat set-back,
    and you don't want it to kick in the stage 2 expensive heat source.

    There is an optional facility to disable this based on zone occupancy.
    Also there is a roll-your-own condition statement for things I haven't thought of.

        These inputs are required, but have values that are defaulted to values that work for me.
          It is possible you will need to change them.
          My suggestion is to not change them until you detect an issue that you think can be
          fixed by changing these.

          In the end, these must have a value.
          This blueprint will work if no changes are made to this section.
