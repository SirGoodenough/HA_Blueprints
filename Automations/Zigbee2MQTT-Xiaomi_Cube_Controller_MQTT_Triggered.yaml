  name: Aqara Magic Cube Zigbee2MQTT MQTT Triggered - 2024-06-02
  author: SirGoodenough
  description: >
    This Blueprint uses a Zigbee2MQTT built sensor to sort out the 38(+54)
    unique commands available from the Xiaomi Magic Cube Remote. (Some unique commands
    are available thru templating only. See the related document.)

    The split out of functions gives you the ability to assign local scripts or functions
    to do the things you want the remote to do.

    Functions that are left empty will simply do nothing.


    ### 🍎 There is a set of 36 event functions that will trigger on specific actions
    on specific sides that are listed as **Group 1 actions 🍎**.


    ### 🍒 There is a set of 6 event functions that will trigger on specific actions
    on *ANY* side that are listed as **Group 2 actions 🍒**.


    ### 🍐 There is a set of 30 event functions that will trigger on cube flips to
    & from specific sides that are listed as **Group 3 actions 🍐**.


    ### 🍕 There are 2 actions (shake and drop) that only occur once and are OK to
    be combined with any other group.  Listed as **Group 4 sections 🍕**.


    Please be aware that ALL actions **except** the **Group 4 actions 🍕**
    will trigger an action in **ALL 3 groups at the same time** every time. Therefore
    I suggest if you just have a couple of things you want this remote to do that
    you choose the *ANY / Group 2 / 🍒* events.

    If you want more than a few events, you should select actions in **Group 1 / 🍎
    OR Group 3 / 🍐**.

    **Group 4 actions 🍕** will not affect others.

    With careful selection you can use mixed groups, but you run the risk of a single
    cube action triggering more than 1 Home Assistant action and making a mess of
    things 🍱.


    #### NOTICE: This cube *can* be triggered 124 ways, but only 38(+54) of them are
    unique (with templating).

    
    There is sample code to make the template sensor in the help file on GitHib named
    [Zigbee2MQTT - Xiaomi Cube Controller MQTT Triggered.md](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Automations/Zigbee2MQTT%20-%20Xiaomi%20Cube%20Controller%20MQTT%20Triggered.md)
    & in the [community page related to this](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zigbee2mqtt-xiaomi-cube-controller/393203).


    Within this blueprint there is an event handler that will latch the last command
    that the blueprint finds and sends that to the event buss. From there a simple
    Template sensor can grab it and show you the last action sent. Thie will help
    when setting up new functions and to troubleshoot strange behaviours.

    1.2 project authored by luckypoppy and the friends he pulled together to create
    the base. I sincerely thank Him (Them) for their work. I felt there needed to
    be more documentation for rookie users to properly set this up. I had quite a
    few questions and when I saw a few questions in that chat from people struggling,
    I wanted to help. I also had a better idea for troubleshooting info.

    * I may or may not be able to support you when you have a problem after you make changes
    to my code, as some of the code is no longer mine.


    * I & my license also require attribution as a link back to the original

        This blueprint has been known to freak out when there are spaces or odd characters
          in the MQTT Topic. Make sure there are no spaces, ONLY a single word,
          and ONLY A thru Z, a thru z, and 0 thru 9 in the topic.
          (```  /  ``` is ok between device and topic)

          If there are other characters, you will need to change the name of the cube to
          remove those characters.

          ### IF YOU SEE --> TemplateError: Must provide a device or entity ID

          If you get an error like that, The friendly_name in Z2M likely does not match the 
          friendly_name on HA. To fix go into the Z2M ```Open web UI``` and set the 
          friendly_name there. Setting this in just HA or in Z2M without ticking the update HA
          box will cause this. See the blueprint documentation page for details.

          If you only want the cube to work like this in the morning,
          then after 6pm you want it to do different actions, add a condition that
          will only let this run from 6am until 6pm. Then have another copy of
          the blueprint that will only run from 6pm until 6am. (for example)

          Any valid conditions you can dream up, you should be able to add here.

          Leave it as the default of you don't want to add a condition of your own.
