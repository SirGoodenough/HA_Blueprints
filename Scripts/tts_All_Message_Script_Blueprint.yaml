    📣 This is a script that can use any of the 11 integrated TTS Platforms
    in Home Assistant to send a message to a media player. Some will require Google
    Type Speakers, some will require Non-Google type speakers.


    These integrations are listed here. Please refer to these pages for care and feeding
    of the *tts_say method you choose. ⛓ https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#text-to-speech


    This blueprint **WILL NOT** set-up TTS for you. You will be given the opportunity
    to add the incorrect options that will **NOT** allow your TTS to function. Your
    best road to success will be to add a TTS session with UI, and only after that
    is successfully talking to you should you take the languages and options that
    work there and apply them in this Blueprint. The safest thing to do other than
    that is to start with the basic sonfiguration for the TTS_say integration that
    you are using and add options one at a time.


    The very basic requirements are for you to provide the *tts_say method that you
    have installed and tested, the entity that you want to send it to, and the message
    you want to send. Beyond that likely involves trial and error that may best be
    done in the Developer Tools Services area here: 
    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your service developer tools.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/developer_services.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_services/)


    I have added an action statement both before and after the main TTS call. You
    can choose to ignore these, or you can use them to change volume, add a 
    media player to play a doorbell, turn on a light, add a delay, 
    whatever you want to do.


    The Scripts produced by this blueprint can be called from an automation & variable
    values for the message and the media_player can be sent on the fly. For details
    [check out the instructions here](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Scripts/tts_All_Message_Script_Blueprint.md#calling).


    ### ⚠️ This Blueprint makes the assumption that you already have a tested & proven
    TTS integration installed and you know how it works and how to use it ⚠️


    You will need to verify that the name you have given to the TTS integration in
    your system configuration is the Default name or you need to change this blueprint
    to use the custom name you have set in the tts: section of configuration.yaml.


    This will be a way to streamline your automations and scripts. It provides specific
    services that can be called with a single line service call. This is contrasted
    to the multiline service calls of repeating values spread throughout your configuration.


    In addition it puts all your TTS specific code in 1 spot, the blueprint, and that
    allows it to be called over and over. Plus it gives you one place, the blueprint,
    to repair issues should they arrise. 🔚

    📩 There is not an official version control system for Blueprints. However I have
    found something that comes pretty close. It is not perfect, but for **MOST**
    Blueprints, it does just fine. I encourage you to check this script out and use
    it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint. 🔗 [koter84 Blueprint Update Script](https://github.com/koter84/HomeAssistant_Blueprints_Update/)

        If you are OK with the default voice then just leave this field empty.

        If you want to change the voice, you need to pick from [This List, TTS_VOICES section](https://github.com/NabuCasa/hass-nabucasa/blob/master/hass_nabucasa/voice.py)
        being certain to match the country code you picked above with one of
        the voices available for that country code on that list.

        Failure to do so will result in no voice being heard.


        Also picking a voice here results in your pick for Gender to be ignored.

        If you want to know what these sound like, well, you are just going to
        have to try them and see what you like.

        If you are en-US, you might want to paste this in there for some fun:
